# RAESS
RAESS (Rapid Adsorption Enthalpy Surface Sampling) is a sampling tool for rapid 

## Installation

Check if you have `c++11` compiler installed (may work with other compiler but has been tested and mainly used with this compiler).

Compilation that follows the rules set in the `Makefile`:
```
make all
```

## Example Usage

If you want to run a surface sampling simulation on the structure KAXQIL (CSD code) from CoRE MOF 2019 all-solvent removed with the Dreiding+uff forcefield at 298K with a 16A cutoff for the xenon. 
```
./raess structure/KAXQIL_clean_14.cif forcefield/UFF.def 298 12 2000 Xe 0.85 1.6
```
You should get an output that has values close to this:
```
KAXQIL_clean_14,-44.4186,0.0283404,70.9159,0.0707517
```

The results are printed in a comma separated format: structure, adsorption enthalpy (kJ/mol), Henry coefficient (mol/kg/Pa), Accessible Surface Area (m2/cm3), Time (s)

This binary is supposed to be used in a high-throughput manner to add rows to a csv file.
